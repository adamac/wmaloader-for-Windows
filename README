wmaloader for Windows
---------------------

wmaloader is an application that serves up firmware to a Linksys WMA11B Media Adapter. This package allows the wmaloader application to run on Windows as a service.  It includes a default image - wmaslimp3 (renamed to wma.img) - but can be modified to serve any image you like.

INITIAL SETUP

If the service is not already installed (this should be done by the application installer), you can install it manually with:

	winsw.exe install
	winsw.exe start

You will need to add wmaloader.exe to your firewall exceptions (installed by default in "Program Files\wmaloader").


CONFIGURATION

To modify the image sent to the WMA11B, first stop the service:

	winsw.exe stop
	winsw.exe uninstall

Next, copy the image to image\wma.img (or edit the winsw.xml file to point to the new .img path).

Then install and start the service:

	winsw.exe install
	winsw.exe start

The uinstall/install steps should only be necessary if you modify the winsw.xml file.
